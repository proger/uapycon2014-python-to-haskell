  - you can buy shavers with lots of blades
  - if you look at the history shaving was hard -- it was done with a knife and required a special person attached to it
  - shaving has been democratized

^ THE THREE MONAD LAWS
^ 
^ A monad may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
^ A monad must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
^ A monad must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

> I don't use mathematics for the sake of using mathematics. The purpose behind structuring programs mathematically is to compose small bits of mathematical functionality, each of which is correct in isolation, to build larger mathematical structures which are still correct.
